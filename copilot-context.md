**About Flexi Choice:**

- It’s a company that provides all types of loans (Home Loan, Gold Loan, Mortgage Loan, Business Loan, Personal Loan)
- It also provides all types of insurance (Health, Term Life, Life Insurance, Vehicle, Travel)
- The website is built with React (JavaScript), Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN UI
- Firebase is used for authentication and Firestore for data
